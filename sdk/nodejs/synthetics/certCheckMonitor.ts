/**
 * Use this resource to create, update, and delete a Synthetics Certificate Check monitor in New Relic.
 *
 * > **IMPORTANT:**  The **Synthetics Legacy Runtime** has reached its <b style="color:red;">end-of-life</b> on <b style="color:red;">October 22, 2024</b>. As a consequence, using the legacy runtime or blank runtime values with Synthetic monitor requests from the New Relic Terraform Provider will result in API errors. Starting with **v3.51.0** of the New Relic Terraform Provider, configurations of Synthetic monitors without runtime attributes or comprising legacy runtime values <span style="color:red;">will be deemed invalid</span>.
 * <br><br>
 * If your Synthetic monitors' configuration is not updated already with new runtime values, upgrade as soon as possible to avoid these consequences. For more details and instructions, please see the detailed warning against `runtimeType` and `runtimeTypeVersion` in the **Argument Reference** section.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const foo = new newrelic.synthetics.CertCheckMonitor("foo", {
 *     name: "Sample Cert Check Monitor",
 *     domain: "www.example.com",
 *     locationsPublics: ["AP_SOUTH_1"],
 *     certificateExpiration: 10,
 *     period: "EVERY_6_HOURS",
 *     status: "ENABLED",
 *     runtimeType: "NODE_API",
 *     runtimeTypeVersion: "16.10",
 *     tags: [{
 *         key: "some_key",
 *         values: ["some_value"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * See additional examples.
 *
 * ## Additional Examples
 *
 * ### Create a monitor with a private location
 *
 * The below example shows how you can define a private location and attach it to a monitor.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** It can take up to 10 minutes for a private location to become available.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const foo = new newrelic.synthetics.PrivateLocation("foo", {
 *     name: "Sample Private Location",
 *     description: "Sample Private Location Description",
 *     verifiedScriptExecution: false,
 * });
 * const fooCertCheckMonitor = new newrelic.synthetics.CertCheckMonitor("foo", {
 *     name: "Sample Cert Check Monitor",
 *     domain: "www.one.example.com",
 *     locationsPrivates: [foo.id],
 *     certificateExpiration: 10,
 *     period: "EVERY_6_HOURS",
 *     status: "ENABLED",
 *     tags: [{
 *         key: "some_key",
 *         values: ["some_value"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * A cert check monitor can be imported using its GUID, using the following command.
