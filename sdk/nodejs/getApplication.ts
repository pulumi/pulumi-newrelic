/**
 * #### DEPRECATED! Use at your own risk. Use the `newrelic..getEntity` data source instead. This feature may be removed in the next major release.
 *
 * Use this data source to get information about a specific application in New Relic that already exists. 
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const app = newrelic.getApplication({
 *     name: "my-app",
 * });
 * const fooAlertPolicy = new newrelic.AlertPolicy("fooAlertPolicy", {});
 * const fooAlertCondition = new newrelic.AlertCondition("fooAlertCondition", {
 *     policyId: fooAlertPolicy.id,
 *     type: "apmAppMetric",
 *     entities: [app.then(app => app.id)],
 *     metric: "apdex",
 *     runbookUrl: "https://www.example.com",
 *     term: [{
 *         duration: 5,
 *         operator: "below",
 *         priority: "critical",
 *         threshold: "0.75",
 *         timeFunction: "all",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
