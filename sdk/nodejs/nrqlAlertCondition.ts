 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ##### Type: `static` (default)
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const foo = new newrelic.AlertPolicy("foo", {name: "foo"});
 * const fooNrqlAlertCondition = new newrelic.NrqlAlertCondition("foo", {
 *     accountId: "12345678",
 *     policyId: foo.id,
 *     type: "static",
 *     name: "foo",
 *     description: "Alert when transactions are taking too long",

 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * See additional examples.
 *
 * ## NRQL
 *
 * The `nrql` block supports the following arguments:
 *
 * - `query` - (Required) The NRQL query to execute for the condition.
 * - `dataAccountId` - (Optional) The account ID to use for the alert condition's query as specified in the the `query` field. If `dataAccountId` is not specified, then the condition's query will be evaluated against the `accountId`. Note that the `accountId` must have read privileges for the `dataAccountId` or else the condition will be invalid.
 * - `evaluationOffset` - (Optional) **DEPRECATED:** Use `aggregationMethod` instead. Represented in minutes and must be within 1-20 minutes (inclusive). NRQL queries are evaluated based on their `aggregationWindow` size. The start time depends on this value. It's recommended to set this to 3 windows. An offset of less than 3 windows will trigger incidents sooner, but you may see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. With `evaluationOffset` set to 3 windows and an `aggregationWindow` of 60 seconds, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: `SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago`. `evaluationOffset` cannot be set with `aggregationMethod`, `aggregationDelay`, or `aggregationTimer`.<br>
 * - `sinceValue` - (Optional)  **DEPRECATED:** Use `aggregationMethod` instead. The value to be used in the `SINCE <X> minutes ago` clause for the NRQL query. Must be between 1-20 (inclusive). <br>
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The direct use of the `term` has been deprecated, and users should use `critical` and `warning` instead.  What follows now applies to the named priority attributes for `critical` and `warning`, but for those attributes the priority is not allowed. At least one `critical` or `warning` term must be defined.
 *
 * NRQL alert conditions support up to two terms. At least one `term` must have `priority` set to `critical` and the second optional `term` must have `priority` set to `warning`.
 *
 * The `term` block supports the following arguments:
 *
 * - `operator` - (Optional) Valid values are `above`, `aboveOrEquals`, `below`, `belowOrEquals`, `equals`, or `notEquals` (case insensitive). Defaults to `equals`. Note that when using a `type` of `baseline`, the only valid option here is `above`.
 * - `priority` - (Optional) `critical` or `warning`. Defaults to `critical`.
 * - `threshold` - (Required) The value which will trigger an incident.
 * <br>For _baseline_ NRQL alert conditions, the value must be in the range [1, 1000]. The value is the number of standard deviations from the baseline that the metric must exceed in order to create an incident.
 * - `thresholdDuration` - (Optional) The duration, in seconds, that the threshold must violate in order to create an incident. Value must be a multiple of the `aggregationWindow` (which has a default of 60 seconds).
 * <br>For _baseline_ NRQL alert conditions, the value must be within 120-86400 seconds (inclusive).
 * <br>For _static_ NRQL alert conditions, the value must be within 60-86400 seconds (inclusive).
 *
 * - `thresholdOccurrences` - (Optional) The criteria for how many data points must be in violation for the specified threshold duration. Valid values are: `all` or `atLeastOnce` (case insensitive).
 * - `duration` - (Optional) **DEPRECATED:** Use `thresholdDuration` instead. The duration of time, in _minutes_, that the threshold must violate for in order to create an incident. Must be within 1-120 (inclusive).
 * - `timeFunction` - (Optional) **DEPRECATED:** Use `thresholdOccurrences` instead. The criteria for how many data points must be in violation for the specified threshold duration. Valid values are: `all` or `any`.
 * - `prediction` - (Optional) **BETA PREVIEW: the `prediction` field is in limited release and only enabled for preview on a per-account basis.** Use `prediction` to open alerts when your static threshold is predicted to be reached in the future. The `prediction` field is only available for _static_ NRQL alert conditions. See Prediction below for details.
 * - `disableHealthStatusReporting` - (Optional) `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false` when field not included in TF config. Violations will not change system health status for this term.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** When a `critical` or `warning` block is added to this resource, using either `duration` or `thresholdDuration` (one of the two) is mandatory. Both of these should not be specified.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** When a `critical` or `warning` block is added to this resource, using either `timeFunction` or `thresholdOccurrences` (one of the two) is mandatory. Both of these should not be specified.
 *
 * ### Prediction
 *
 * > **BETA PREVIEW:** The `prediction` block is in limited release and only enabled for preview on a per-account basis.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The `prediction` block is only available for _static_ NRQL alert conditions.
 *
 * The `prediction` block supports the following arguments:
 *
 * - `predictBy` - (Optional) The duration, in seconds, that the prediction should look into the future. Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
 * - `preferPredictionViolation` - (Optional) If a prediction incident is open when a term's static threshold is breached by the actual signal, default behavior is to close the prediction incident and open a static incident. Setting `preferPredictionViolation` to `true` overrides this behavior leaving the prediction incident open and preventing a static incident from opening. Default is false.
 *
 * ## Outlier Configuration
 *
 * > **BETA PREVIEW:** The `outlier` condition type is in limited release and only enabled for preview on a per-account basis.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The `outlierConfiguration` block is only available for _outlier_ NRQL alert conditions.
 *
 * The `outlierConfiguration` block supports the following nested block:
 * - `dbscan` - (Required) The DBSCAN algorithm configuration block.
 *
 * `dbscan` supports the following arguments:
 * - `epsilon` - (Required) The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other. Value must be > 0.
 * - `minimumPoints` - (Required) The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself. Value must be >= 1.
 * - `evaluationGroupFacet` - (Optional) NRQL facet attribute used to segment data into groups (e.g. `host`, `region`) before running outlier detection. Omit to evaluate all results together.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Currently only `dbscan` is supported.
 *
 * ## Additional Examples
 *
 * ##### Type: `baseline`
 *
 * [Baseline NRQL alert conditions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-baseline-alert-conditions) are dynamic in nature and adjust to the behavior of your data. The example below demonstrates a baseline NRQL alert condition for alerting when transaction durations are above a specified threshold and dynamically adjusts based on data trends.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const foo = new newrelic.AlertPolicy("foo", {name: "foo"});
 * const fooNrqlAlertCondition = new newrelic.NrqlAlertCondition("foo", {
 *     type: "baseline",
 *     accountId: "12345678",
 *     name: "foo",
 *     policyId: foo.id,
 *     description: "Alert when transactions are taking too long",
 *     enabled: true,
 *     runbookUrl: "https://www.example.com",
 *     violationTimeLimitSeconds: 3600,
 *     aggregationMethod: "event_flow",
 *     aggregationDelay: "120",
 *     slideBy: 30,
 *     baselineDirection: "upper_only",
 *     signalSeasonality: "weekly",
 *     nrql: {
 *         query: "SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'ExampleAppName'",
 *     },
 *     critical: {
 *         operator: "above",
 *         threshold: 5.5,
 *         thresholdDuration: 300,
 *         thresholdOccurrences: "all",
 *     },
 *     warning: {
 *         operator: "above",
 *         threshold: 3.5,
 *         thresholdDuration: 600,
 *         thresholdOccurrences: "all",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * <br> 
 *
 * ##### Type: `outlier`
 *
 * > **BETA PREVIEW:** The `outlier` condition type is in limited release and only enabled for preview on a per-account basis.
 *
 * [Outlier NRQL alert conditions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/outlier-detection/) are dynamic in nature and adjust to the behavior of your data. The example below demonstrates an outlier NRQL alert condition for detecting anomalies using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const outlierPolicy = new newrelic.AlertPolicy("outlier_policy", {name: "outlier-demo"});
 * const outlierCondition = new newrelic.NrqlAlertCondition("outlier_condition", {
 *     accountId: "12345678",
 *     policyId: outlierPolicy.id,
 *     type: "outlier",
 *     name: "Outlier duration anomaly",
 *     description: "Detect hosts with anomalous average duration",
 *     enabled: true,
 *     violationTimeLimitSeconds: 3600,
 *     aggregationWindow: 60,
 *     aggregationMethod: "event_flow",
 *     nrql: {
 *         query: "SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET host",
 *     },
 *     outlierConfiguration: {
 *         dbscan: {
 *             epsilon: 0.15,
 *             minimumPoints: 5,
 *             evaluationGroupFacet: "host",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     critical: {
 *         operator: "above",
 *         threshold: 0,
 *         thresholdDuration: 300,
 *         thresholdOccurrences: "all",
 *     },
 * });

 *
 * ## Upgrade from 1.x to 2.x
 *
 * There have been several deprecations in the `newrelic.NrqlAlertCondition`
 * resource. Users will need to make some updates in order to have a smooth
 * upgrade.
 *
 * An example resource from 1.x might look like the following.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const z = new newrelic.NrqlAlertCondition("z", {
 *     policyId: zNewrelicAlertPolicy.id,
 *     name: "zleslie-test",
 *     type: "static",
 *     runbookUrl: "https://localhost",
 *     enabled: true,
 *     violationTimeLimit: "TWENTY_FOUR_HOURS",
 *     critical: {
 *         operator: "above",
 *         thresholdDuration: 120,
 *         threshold: 3,
 *         thresholdOccurrences: "AT_LEAST_ONCE",
 *     },
 *     nrql: {
 *         query: "SELECT count(*) FROM TransactionError WHERE appName like '%Dummy App%' FACET appName",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * After making the appropriate adjustments mentioned in the deprecation warnings,
 * the resource now looks like the following.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const z = new newrelic.NrqlAlertCondition("z", {
 *     policyId: zNewrelicAlertPolicy.id,
 *     name: "zleslie-test",
 *     type: "static",
 *     runbookUrl: "https://localhost",
 *     enabled: true,
 *     violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400,
 *     terms: [{
 *         priority: "critical",
 *         operator: "above",
 *         threshold: 3,
 *         duration: 5,
 *         timeFunction: "any",
 *     }],
 *     nrql: {
 *         query: "SELECT count(*) FROM TransactionError WHERE appName like '%Dummy App%' FACET appName",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * NRQL alert conditions can be imported using a composite ID of `<policy_id>:<condition_id>:<conditionType>`, e.g.
 *
 * // For `baseline` conditions
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import newrelic:index/nrqlAlertCondition:NrqlAlertCondition foo 538291:6789035:baseline
 * ```
 *
 * // For `static` conditions
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import newrelic:index/nrqlAlertCondition:NrqlAlertCondition foo 538291:6789035:static
 * ```
 *
 * Users can find the actual values for `policy_id` and `condition_id` from the New Relic One UI under respective policy and condition.
