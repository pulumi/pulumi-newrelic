/**
 * The `newrelic.Group` resource facilitates creating, updating, and deleting groups in New Relic, while also enabling the addition and removal of users from these groups.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const foo = newrelic.getAuthenticationDomain({
 *     name: "Test Authentication Domain",
 * });
 * const fooGroup = new newrelic.Group("foo", {
 *     name: "Test Group",
 *     authenticationDomainId: foo.then(foo => foo.id),
 *     userIds: [
 *         "0001112222",
 *         "2221110000",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Additional Examples
 *
 * ### Addition of New Users to a New Group
 *
 * The following example illustrates the creation of a group using the `newrelic.Group` resource, to which users created using the `newrelic.User` resource are added.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const foo = newrelic.getAuthenticationDomain({
 *     name: "Test Authentication Domain",
 * });
 * const fooUser = new newrelic.User("foo", {
 *     name: "Test User One",
 *     emailId: "test_user_one@test.com",
 *     authenticationDomainId: foo.then(foo => foo.id),
 *     userType: "CORE_USER_TIER",
 * });
 * const bar = new newrelic.User("bar", {
 *     name: "Test User Two",
 *     emailId: "test_user_two@test.com",
 *     authenticationDomainId: foo.then(foo => foo.id),
 *     userType: "BASIC_USER_TIER",
 * });
 * const fooGroup = new newrelic.Group("foo", {
 *     name: "Test Group",
 *     authenticationDomainId: foo.then(foo => foo.id),
 *     userIds: [
 *         fooUser.id,
 *         bar.id,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Addition of Existing Users to a New Group
 *
 * The following example demonstrates the usage of the `newrelic.Group` resource to create a group, wherein the `newrelic.User` data source is employed to associate existing users with the newly formed group.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as newrelic from "@pulumi/newrelic";
 *
 * const foo = newrelic.getAuthenticationDomain({
 *     name: "Test Authentication Domain",
 * });
 * const fooGetUser = foo.then(foo => newrelic.getUser({
 *     authenticationDomainId: foo.id,
 *     emailId: "test_user_one@test.com",
 * }));
 * const bar = foo.then(foo => newrelic.getUser({
 *     authenticationDomainId: foo.id,
 *     name: "Test User Two",
 * }));
 * const fooGroup = new newrelic.Group("foo", {
 *     name: "Test Group",
 *     authenticationDomainId: foo.then(foo => foo.id),
 *     userIds: [
 *         fooGetUser.then(fooGetUser => fooGetUser.id),
 *         bar.then(bar => bar.id),
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **NOTE** Please note that the addition of users to groups is only possible when both the group and the users to be added to it belong to the _same authentication domain_. If the group being created and the users being added to it belong to different authentication domains, an error indicating `user not found` or an equivalent error will be thrown.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * A group can be imported using its ID. Example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import newrelic:index/group:Group foo <group_id>
 * ```
