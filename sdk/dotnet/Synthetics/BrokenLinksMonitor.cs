As a consequence of this API change, all requests associated with Synthetic Monitors (except Ping Monitors) going out of the New Relic Terraform Provider &lt;span style="color:maroon;"&gt;will be blocked by an API error&lt;/span&gt; if they include values corresponding to the legacy runtime or blank runtime values.

If your monitors' configuration &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;is not updated with new runtime values&lt;/span&gt;, you will see the consequences stated here.
